# Hi, I'm Subhadeep 👋

I'm a full-stack developer who enjoys building fast, scalable, and user-focused web applications.  
I focus on creating complete products—clean architecture, efficient APIs, and polished UIs.

### 🔧 Technologies I work with
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind
- **Backend:** Node.js, Next.js API Routes, Express
- **Databases & Tools:** MongoDB, Redis, Cloudinary
- **Other:** Authentication, caching, testing (Jest/Cypress), cloud deployments

### 🚀 Projects I'm proud of
- **Blog Platform** – Full-featured blog system with custom editor, file uploads, caching, and a clean UI.  
- **Online Editor** – Multi-page text editor simulating a word processor, built with modern tooling.  
- **Developer tools / experiments** – Small utilities, reusable components, and backend experiments.

### 📌 What I'm focusing on now
Building a unique, impactful real-world project that solves an actual problem—not another CRUD app.
